# Overview
Cognitive load refers to the amount of mental effort or resources required to complete a
task or process information (Paas et al. 2016). With the recent trend in using Virtual Reality
(VR) environments for learning and the impact of cognitive load on learning success
(Sweller et al. 2011), it is important to consider cognitive load when designing these
environments. Currently, cognitive load detection relies heavily on subjective measures,
such as self-reports and questionnaires, which do not allow real-time feedback to learners
and instructors. In our study, we want to design and evaluate an AI agent that gauge the cognitive load after a
task and provides a better suited follow-up task for the user. This is the codebase for that agent.
