This dataset was created using the findings by the authors of the paper "Exploring Unimodal Notification Interaction and Display Methods in Augmented Reality": (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3611659.3615683)

## Dataset 
This dataset contains the relevant information processed from the raw data collected during the experiments in the original paper.

ID - The ID of the participant
TimeX - The time in seconds of the duration of the task in condition X
ErrorsX - The number of errors made by the participant in condition X
MWSX - The mental workload score of the participant in condition X

Condition - The condition of the experiment (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

For our experiments, we treat all conditions as the same, since the goal is to predict the cognitive load of the participant, regardless of the condition.
